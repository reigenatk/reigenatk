### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Richard. I upload all my projects here (in case my hard drive decides to die), some of which are half complete. Most are not related to school, but rather just side projects that I explore during my freetime. 

I am still trying to figure out where exactly my interests lie in the vast field of computer science, but for now I have a slight preference for systems and low level programming as you might be able to tell. Anything but web programming, I honestly had enough of that when I tried making my personal site.

Some projects are unfinished/abandoned, but most are done. Most follow some tutorial/guide, because I'm not great at coming up with original things yet. But hopefully someday I can create something worth sharing.

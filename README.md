### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Richard. I upload all my projects here, some of which are half complete. Most are not related to school, but rather just side projects that I explore during my freetime.

I am still trying to figure out where exactly my interests lie in the vast field of computer science, but for now I have a slight preference for systems and low level programming as you might be able to tell. Anything but web programming honestly, I had enough of that when I tried making my personal site.

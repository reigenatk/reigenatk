### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Richard. I upload all my projects here (in case my hard drive decides to die). Most of them are not related to school, but rather just side projects that I explore during my freetime. 

I am still trying to figure out where exactly my interests lie in the vast field of computer science, but for now I have a slight preference for systems and low level programming as you might be able to tell. Anything but web programming, I honestly had enough of that when I tried making my personal site.

Some projects are unfinished/abandoned, since I either got bored or it was too hard. I like to follow some tutorial/guide when coding, because I'm not great at coming up with original things yet. I suppose I'm still in the learning phase. But hopefully someday I can create something worth sharing from scratch.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Richard. I upload all my projects here, some of which are half complete. Most are not related to school, but rather just something I explore during my freetime.

I am still trying to figure out what space of CS I would like to work in the future, but I have a slight preference for systems and low level programming as you might be able to tell.

Thanks for visiting!
